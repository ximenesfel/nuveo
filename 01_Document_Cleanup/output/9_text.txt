There are several classic spatial filters for reducing or elimin
from images. The mean filler. the median filter and the closing 0
uscd. The mean filler is a loupass or smoothing filter that rep:
the neighborhood mvan. It reduces the image noise but blurs the
filter calculates the median of the pizcl neighborhood for cach 7
blurring effect. Finally. the opening closing filter is a mathem
that combines the same number of erosion and dilation morpho
to eliminate small objects from images.
The main goal was fo train a neural network ina supervisea
image from a noisy one. In this particular case, it was much ca
noisy image from a.clean one than to clean a subset of noisy
