There are several classic spatial filters for reducing or climin
from images. The mean filter, the median filter and the closing o
used. The mean filter is a lowpass or smoothing filter that replace
neighborhood mean. tt reduces the image noise but blurs the imag

calculates the median of the pixel neighborhood for each pixel, th
effect. Finally, the opening closing filter is a mathematical morpho

The main goal was to train a neural network in a supervised
image from a noisy one. In this particular case, it was much easicr
-image from a clean one than to clean a subset of noisy images.
