There are several classic spatial filters for reducing or elimin
from images. The mean filter, the median filter and the closing o
used. The mean filter is a lowpass or smoothing filter that replace
neighborhood mean. It reduces the image noise but blurs the imag

effect. Finally, the opening closing filter is a mathematical morphc

The main goal was to train a neural network in a supervised
image from a noisy one. In this particular case, it was much easier
_image from a clean one than to clean a subset of noisy images.
