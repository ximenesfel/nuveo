There are several classic spatial filters
high frequency noise from images. The mean j
and the closing opening filter are frequentls
ts a loupass or smoothing filter that replace
with the netghborhood mean. It reduces the +
the image edges. The median filter calculate
pirel neighborhood for each pizel, thereby re
effect. Finally, the opening closing filter
filter that combines the same number of eros:
operations in order to eliminate small object
The matn goal was to train a neural networ
to obtain a clean image from a noisy one. It
tt was much easter to obtain a simulated nots
one than to clean a subset of noisy images.
stmulated noisy images follows this scheme:
