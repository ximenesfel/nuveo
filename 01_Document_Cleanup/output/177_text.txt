There are several classic spatial filters for reducing Â¢
quency noise from images. The mean filter, the media
. opening filter are frequently used. The mean filter is a
filter that replaces the pixel values with the neighborhood
image noise but blurs the image edges. The median filte

Finally, the opening closing filter is a mathematical m
