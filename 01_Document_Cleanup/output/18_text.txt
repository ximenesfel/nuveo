There are several classic spatial filters for reducing or elimin.
from images. The mcan filter, the median filtcr and the closing o)
used. The mean filter is a lowpass or smoothing filter that rep]
the neighborhood mean. It reduces the image noise but blurs the
filter calculates the median of the pixcl neighborhood for each p
blurring effect. Finally, the opening closing filtcr is a mathemy
that combines the same number of erosion and dilation morphoi
to eliminate small objects from images.
â€˜The main goa! was to train a neural network in a supervised
image from a noisy one. In this particular case, it was much ca
