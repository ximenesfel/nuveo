There are several classic spatial filters for reducing or elimin
Jrom images. The mean filler, the median filler and the closing o
used. The mean filter is a loupass or smoothing filler that rep,
the neighborhood mean. It reduces the image noise but blurs the
filter calculates the median of the pizel neighborhood for cach 4
blurring effect. Finally, the opening closing filler 1s a mathem
that combines the same number of erosion and dilation morpho
to eliminate small objects from images.
The main goal was to train a neural network in @ supervisea
image from a noisy one. In this particular case, it was much ea
