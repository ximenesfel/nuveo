There are several classic spatial filters for reducing or elimin.
from images. The mean filter, the median filter and the closing 0}
used. The mean filter is a lowpass or smoothing filter that repl
the neighborhood mean. It reduces the image noise but blurs the
filter calculates the median of the pixel neighborhood for each p
blurring effect. Finally. the opening closing filter is a mathem:

that combines the same number of erosion and dilation morpho!
to climinate small objects from images.

â€˜The tain goal was to train a neural network in a supervised
image from a noisy one. In this particular case, it was much ea
